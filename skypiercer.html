    <h1>SKYPIERCER</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Boston office</p><p>Skypiercer is The Matrix's planned office in Boston, USA. It is going to be the tallest building in Boston. This is low-hanging fruit, only requiring 242 feet of skyscraper height to achieve. This should cost roughly 1 billion US dollars to build.</p><p>Each floor in Skypiercer is the office of a <a href='thematrixholdings.html'>company in The Matrix</a>. An ecosystem of companies share resources like intelligence, labor, and machines to achieve their goals. The penthouse of this skyscraper hosts parties every weekend for interaction amongst companies because The Matrix bets on the network effect of the smartest people in the world being in the same club.</p><p>The name skypiercer stems from a long-term vision of building space elevators in this skyscraper. In the top floor of skypiercers, a jump will take you to space to experience weightlessness.</p>
