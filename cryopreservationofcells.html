Take pictures and write down your observations. Introduce your flask to the biosafety cabinet.</li><li>Save some of the current culture media in the flask for trypsin inactivation/detachment enzyme dilution (later step) by pipetting out the current media into 15 or 50 ml conical tubes.<ul><li>8-10 ml per T175, 5 ml per T75, 1-2 ml per T25<ul><li>Multiple flasks of the same cells can be pooled together in a big tube.</li></ul></li><li><em>Be sure to not disturb the adherent cell layer on the bottom of the flask (e.g do not allow the pipette to come in contact with the bottom of the flask).</em></li></ul></li><li>Aspirate the rest of the current culture media from each flask.<ul><li>If there are many flasks (e.g more than 4-5) you may want to split this step and the next into batches to minimize the time the cells spend without liquid</li><li><em>Be sure to not disturb the adherent cell layer on the bottom of the flask.</em></li></ul></li><li>Add sterile DPBS to the sidewall of each flask to rinse out residual culture media. Swish DPBS gently so that the bottom surface is completely covered.<ul><li>Amounts are arbitrary, e.g 7 ml for T175, 5 ml for T75, 2-3 ml for T25</li></ul></li><li>Aspirate the DPBS and add 0.25% trypsin-EDTA to the sidewall of the flasks. Swish the trypsin gently so that the bottom surface is completely covered.<ul><li>Trypsin: 4 ml for T175, 2.5 ml for T75, 1 ml for T25</li><li>Ensure that the bottom surface is completely covered by the enzyme solution.</li><li><em>Be sure to not disturb the adherent cell layer on the bottom of the flask when aspirating.</em></li></ul></li><li>Incubate the flasks at 37°C for 4-10 minutes.<ul><li>Duration depends on cells and detachment enzyme<ul><li>Trypsin usually 4-5 min, as short of a time as possible to minimize harm.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Check each flask for complete cell detachment with the light microscope, viewing several areas of the flask to be sure.<ul><li>If all the cells are balled up but not all are detached, you should be able to gently smack the sidewall of the flask with your hand to dislodge them.</li><li>Detached cells appear to look like floating spheres.</li></ul></li><li>Dilute/neutralize the detachment enzymes with the old media you saved (step 3).<ul><li>Dispense old media/trypsin inhibitor onto the bottom surface of the flask to wash off any cells that might still be attached.</li><li>Collect in the 15 or 50 ml conical tubes that held the old culture media.<ul><li>Multiple flasks of the same cells can be pooled together.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Make sure that the cell suspension is homogenous/well-mixed (triturate or pipet up and down 5-10x), then load a hemocytometer for cell counting</li><li>Centrifuge/Spin the cells down at 300 x g for 5 min, at RT. Count the cells while centrifuging.<ul><li>Record the volume of the cell suspension for cell number calculations.</li><li>Remember to balance the centrifuge.</li><li>Viable Cell Number Calculations: [# cells/ml] * [dilution factor if cell suspension is diluted] * [total volume of the cell suspension in ml] * [cell viability %]</li><li>To calculate the final resuspension volume (mL), divide [total # of cells] by the [desired cell concentration (# of cells/ml)].</li></ul></li><li>After centrifugation, aspirate out the supernatant.</li><li>Resuspend your cell pellet in fresh, warmed BSC-GM such that the final concentration is roughly 1.1 million cells/ml.</li><li>Label cryovials with the cell type, passage number, your team name/initials, the date, and “1 million cells.”<ul><li>NOTE: The passage number does not change until your cells touch new plastic flasks/plates.</li><li>You will need one cryovial for every 1 million cells. </li></ul></li><li>Add DMSO such that the final concentration of DMSO is 10%. Mix well.<ul><li>Freezing medium is 90% GM, 10% DMSO</li></ul></li><li>Quickly transfer 1 ml of cell suspension in the freezing medium to each cryovial.</li><li>Transfer the vials to the isopropanol cooling container and place in -80°C.</li></ol></p><p>This protocol was developed for BME 174: cultivated meat laboratory course at <a href='https://www.tufts.edu'>Tufts University</a>.
