    <p>DNA inside out</p><p>Projects include 4th generation DNA sequencing, <a href='#storegg'>Storegg</a> human ovum cryo-storage, biobanks, and DNA-based census of all (8 billion) humans.</p><p>In 4th generation DNA sequencing, Lucidna is engineering DNA polymerase to work as a nanopore. Combining DNA polymerase with a signaling pathway should generate a base-specific signal for each nucelotide. The signaling pathway may be wavelength-dependent luciferase, fluorescence, or quantum dots.</p><p><a href='#storegg' id='storegg'>Storegg</a> is to save humanity from the birth rate crisis. We believe any humans who want to have children should be able to do so, so we're increasing the fertile window for human females through cryo-storage. While ovum storage is not new, it is still very expensive. We're collaborating with egg storage facilities and bearing the initial and yearly costs of ovum storage for 10 years. This investment (funded in part by government subsidies) is a bet on the future. Starting in Italy and Japan.</p><p>Biobanks store human cells for future use. Stem cells stored in biobanks may be used in for organ regeneration, and personalized medicine that lowers immune response. We understand the importance of biobanks and hypothesize most medicines of the future will be personalized. By linking biobanks to <a href='asbl.html'>ASBL</a>, we intend to manufacture better medicines.</p><p>DNA-based humanity census ascertains verifiable humanity. Human life is most valuable is the tenet The Matrix is built upon. We realiably ascertain humans in our system to use the entire system to assist the humans. Faces change, fingerprints erode, eyes get damaged, but DNA remains mostly constant and trackable through blood tests. This is why identity in The Matrix needs a DNA-based humanity census. A ledger of all humanity. Used for <a href='musings.html#reviveledger'>revive ledger</a>.</p><p>We won't dnabank people who choose no outreach (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncontacted_peoples'>uncontacted peoples</a>), though they are forever welcome. Visas, passports, and social security numbers need this update; how long will humanity go through stamps on paper and address-based identity? This is a human verification layer. Lucidna prioritizes privacy because DNA sequence data is the best identifier of humans. Since DNA is easily accessible (humans have hairfall, dead skin drops off), a version of DNA needs to be made that is based on an individual's DNA yet extremely difficult to generate unless you are truly that human. We're working on it.</p>
