    <p>Cyborgs with biotechnology</p><p><a href='#earpods' id='earpods'>Earpods</a> are <a href='https://www.apple.com/airpods/'>AirPods</a> made of living cells. They donâ€™t need to be taken off. Artificial cells are attached near your eardrum. They exert force using cilia. The force exerted is detected by the eardrum as sound. Cilia produce soundwaves. Force exertion using cilia is controlled using <a href='#redtooth'>Redtooth</a>. Similar to Bluetooth, it converts audio waves to signals for cilia to move in specific waves to produce. Spotify connects to your ear using Redtooth and plays music. Earpods detect soundwaves of a different language, translate it into your native tongue, and play it on your eardrum. You hear in your native tongue what someone says in theirs.</p><p><a href='#redtooth' id='redtooth'>Redtooth</a> is wireless communication with biological cells.</p><p><a href='#ais' id='ais'>Artificial immune system</a> (AIS) is a networked therapeutic. Like CAR-T therapy and vaccines are updates to our natural immune systems, AIS is collection of monthly updates to ensure optimal aging and real-time protection against disease. AIS contains synthetic cells to target novel diseases. These cells are modified stem cells derived from the human they will be implanted in (autologous cell therapy). AIS burns excess bodyfat by converting it to voltage (energy equivalence), that is used to fight disease.</p><p><a href='#biomotor' id='biomotor'>Biomotor</a> is a biological motor. <a href='https://doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0031598'>Isolated muscular fibers show continuous contracting motion deriving energy from lipids.</a> This can be used to create pressure waves inside cells, creating repetitive motion for an electric motor. Ionization and current flow can be caused by optogenetics (voltage-gated calcium channels) directly from the muscle cells without a magnetic field. Biomotors can detect stuff inside cells (conditions that make the muscles move), and consume biomass (lipids) to create motion (medicinal liposuction without surgery).</p><p><a href='#bioniceyes' id='bioniceyes'>Bionic eyes</a> for melding of digital and base reality with hallucinatory apps. Controlled schizophrenia for virtual reality. Bionic eyes require surgery, but a chip in your brain made from your own neurons that makes you hallucinate apps doesn't. Indistinguishable from reality.</p><p><a href='#biotattoo' id='biotattoo'>Biotattoo</a> is a pill that makes tattoos. Create a pill for the tattoo you want. Take it and the tattoo appears. Targeted drug delivery (TDD) technology delivers ink particles to specific epithelial cells. Another way is to put excitable ink particles in bloodstream. Light shone at a specific body part activates ink particles. They change form, become biologically active, and synthesize non-toxic ink particles in epithelial cells. Easily removable tattoos without pain.</p><p>Change gene expression to create impenetrable bulletproof skin. Cells bond tightly using organometals (zinc oxide, cadmium oxide) that nothing breaks the surface.</p><p>Automatic numbing of skin surface neurons to not feel cold. Cells modified to keep generating heat and stay functional even in extreme cold. Thicker fat layer for cold resistance being used in <a href='https://colossal.com/'>Colossal Biosciences</a> to genetically edit elephants to be mammoth-like.</p><p>Brain uses more energy obtained from fat decomposition (part of <a href='#ais'>artificial immune system</a>). Dreams that cause weight loss and build chosen physique.</p><p>Electromagnetic waves cause hair follicle cells to get controlled cancer and start regrowing hair.</p><p>Thymus regeneration for T-cell replenishment</p><p>Neuronal regeneration against Alzheimer's disease. <a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s41582-018-0116-6'>Therapeutics targeting amyloid beta plaques aren't successful</a> because the number of dead brain neurons increases with age. This must be reversed.</p><p>Based on a new verb cyborg-ing, this company helps humans become cyborgs using biotechnology. The Matrix approach is to modify human bodies using biocompatible materials and approaches (gene therapy, stem cells).</p>
