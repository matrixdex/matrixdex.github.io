            <h1>VERIFICATION OF ADIPOGENICITY AND MYOGENICITY</h1>
            <br>
            <p>General Notes</p><p>Typically, immunostaining is performed to verify myosin-heavy-chain (MHC) in muscle cell cultures. Because this is a two-day process and requires a fluorescent microscope, we are using alternative methods to view myotubes<br>Because the cells have been fixed, we are no longer worried about contamination and can do everything outside of the biosafety cabinet<br>LADD stain is a blue/purple stain we can use to visualize cells/tissues. Proliferating cells should have a light cells and dark nuclei, while differentiated myotubes should have dark staining in the tubes and light staining in the nuclei<br>Oil Red O is a red stain for neutral lipids that can be both visualized with light microscopy or quantified in a plate reader by eluting the dye with isopropanol</p><p>Materials </p><p>70% ethanol (used by instructors to fix cells)<br>4% Paraformaldehyde (used by instructors to fix cells)<br>PBS<br>LADD stain<br>Oil Red O<br>Propylene Glycol<br>Hematoxylin<br>Distilled water<br>96-well plate<br>Waste beaker<br>Heat block/water bath set to 60C<br>Plate reader<br>Phase-contrast light microscope</p><p>Method</p><p>LADD Stain (for muscle cells)</p><p>Done previously by instructors:</p><p><ol><li>Carefully aspirate media from each well of your muscle cells (4x wells in a 12-well plate)</li><li>Add 1 mL of PBS to each well (avoid directly pipetting liquid onto the culture, instead try to add it to the side of the well to avoid disrupting your cultures)</li><li>Remove the PBS</li><li>Add 500 uL 70% ethanol to each well for 10 minutes to fix cells</li><li>Aspirate 70% ethanol, replace with PBS and store in the fridge</li></ol></p><p>To do in class:</p><p><ol><li>Carefully remove the PBS by pipetting it into the waste beaker</li><li>Add 500 uL LADD stain for 60 seconds â€“ check that this covers the bottom of the well. If not, add more.<ol><li><em>LADD will stain the benchtop/anything it comes into contact with; please be careful to not drip/spill!</em></li></ol></li><li>Remove LADD, wash with 1 mL distilled water (i.e., pipette water into the well and then out and into the waste beaker) until the water no longer looks purple </li><li>Add 500 uL PBS to each well</li><li>View cells under the light microscope, take an image with your cell phone to use for your lab report and note any observations</li></ol></p><p>Oil Red O (for fat cells)</p><p>Done previously by instructors:</p><p><ol><li>Fix cells in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes (in fume hood)<ol><li>Aspirate media and rinse twice with prewarmed 1x PBS</li><li>Pipette onto side of wells to not disrupt adherent cells with direct contact</li></ol></li><li>Rinse 3x with warm 1x PBS to remove any remaining paraformaldehyde, store in fridge</li></ol></p><p>To do in class:</p><p><ol><li>Heat Oil Red O solution in preheated 60C water bath/heat block</li><li>Pipette out PBS and add 1 mL propylene glycol for 5 minutes</li><li>Remove propylene glycol and add 1 mL of heated (60C) Oil Red O Solution for 7 minutes</li><li>Prepare a solution of 85% propylene glycol in distilled water</li><li>Remove Oil Red O and add 1 mL 85% propylene glycol for 1 minute</li><li>Rinse each well twice with distilled water (carefully pipette to remove)</li><li>View cells under the light microscope, take an image with your cell phone to use for your lab report and note any observations</li></ol></p><p>Quantitative assessment of the degree of staining</p><p><ol><li>After imaging, take your plate to the fume hood (ask an instructor to help)</li><li>Add 500 uL isopropanol to each well to elute the Oil Red O</li><li>Immediately collect the isopropanol and transfer to a 96-well plate<ol><li>The entire class will share one 96-well plate, so note where your group loaded your samples on the plate</li><li>Load some wells with isopropanol as a blank reading</li></ol></li><li>Read optical density at 540 nm on a plate reader (<em>Instructors will do this once everyone has loaded their samples</em>)</li><li>Take picture of plate results</li></ol></p><p>References</p><p> McColl, R., Nkosi, M., Snyman, C., & Niesler, C.
