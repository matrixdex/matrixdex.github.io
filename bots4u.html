    <h1>BOTS 4 U</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Tech consultancy</p><p>Bots4U is a tech consultancy for software and lab automation.</p><p><a href='https://github.com/orgs/matrixdex/repositories'>The Matrix codebase on GitHub</a>.</p><p>Our codebase has 5 opensource projects. You are free to embed these projects in your organizational codebase. If you want programmers in Bots4U to embed these projects into your codebase, we offer yearly contracts.</p><p><a href='https://github.com/matrixdex/ecoli-fba'>E. coli flux balance analysis</a> performs steady state flux balance analysis on E. coli core metabolism. It models the metabolism of an E. coli cell using a network of reactions. The flux, or amount of reactant converting to product, of each link in this reaction network is determined using an assumption of steady state. Steady state assumes products and reactants don't accumulate in the cell and there are no concentration-dependent effects on metabolism. These MATLAB scripts find how active each metabolic pathway is and allows metabolic analysis of genetic knockouts on E. coli.</p><p><a href='https://github.com/alinoorul/stdinfo'>STDinfo</a> implements privacy-preserving data analytics for medical data. It is a Python script that infers transmission risk from 2 medical test reports. It is applied to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) to find transmission risk between 2 individuals based on their STD panel test reports while keeping the reports private. Performing data analytics while keeping underlying data private has uses in healthcare data analyses, semiconductor fabrication optimization and privacy in large language models. If you'd like for us to explore these or other applications to implement STDinfo in your organization, we are currently running a free pilot till May 2024.</p><p><a href='https://github.com/matrixdex/devpy'>Webdex</a> is a bot in Python takes text files and PDFs converts them into a website through a JSON format. Hyperlinking pages still requires human understanding and needs a human mind, but Webdex assists. Neural, a programmer for hire in The Matrix, built this script to repeatedly update and deploy <a href='https://github.com/alinoorul/alinoorul.github.io'>The Matrix Dex</a> as fast as once a minute. This also implements a single locus of control for a website. You can edit text, links and titles of a website from one JSON-editing interface.</p><p>ONITO is an application for electronic health records. Within ONITO, there are multiple projects: <a href='https://github.com/alinoorul/MedKnow'>Medknow</a> implements database access for electronic health records, <a href='https://github.com/alinoorul/kaplanmeier-ai'>KM</a> converts images of Kaplan-Meier charts into CSV files. ONITO's web application implemented an early view of machine learning aided diagnostics in a clinical setting. We would like to clarify that the web application demonstrated in the video is a frontend, not linked to machine learning models or electronic health record storage. Dummy data and models were used.</p><p><a href='https://github.com/alinoorul/automeet'>Automeet</a> is a bot to attend video meetings. It keeps track of a timetable to attend and exit Google meetings within given times. Graphical user interface is manipulated using basic computer vision to enter and exit a video conference just as a human would. This bot may be reconfigured for GUI manipulation using computer vision or making summaries of video meetings.</p><p>Contact: <a href='mailto:manonthemoon13131@gmail.com'>manonthemoon13131@gmail.com</a></p><p>Noorul started Bots4U to earn $9M to build <a href='asbl.html'>ASBL</a> Lab 0. But Bots4U goes deeper. While Noorul embeds his code in organizations, he is creating a bot called Neural to maintain that code. Neural is a society of bots performing tasks that human programmers would be performing in 2023, like DevOps, code maintenance and debugging.</p>
