    <h1>CNS ROBOTS</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Robots with a central nervous system</p><p>Robots have limbs, wheels, and actuators. These devices run on numbers. A sequence of bits programs a motor to spin at some frequency, and limbs to have a specific configuration. This is very similar to how human limbs work. Electric and chemical signals cause limbs to behave in a certain way. There is information equivalence between the two. CNS robots will have no firmware, driver, or compiler layers. Layers of abstraction from electric currents (bits) to Python programs were designed for human beings, because we cannot think in bits. Neural networks donâ€™t have this limitation. They can think in numbers (artificial) or electrical and chemical signals (biological). A neural network can thus learn behavior without needing explicit programming. This is the next step in robotics. CNS robots that learn behavior through numbers or information. Like how a human baby learns.</p><p>Builds robots with a central nervous system, using <a href='informationmechanics.html'>information mechanics</a> (IM). New generation of botmaking. Layered software architecture was designed to split development among humans. IM makes building robots akin to behavior learning like in living organisms. Searching for rapid automated development.</p>
