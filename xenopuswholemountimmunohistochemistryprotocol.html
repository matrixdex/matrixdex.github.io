                        <p>General notes</p><p><ol><li>Everything happens in scint vials, with max volume of changes.</li><li>Be very careful when changing solutions not to suck up the sections or small samples – always be sure you can see all the samples in the tube before putting in the suction.</li><li>Each vial is about 25 ml volume, so calculate how much total solution you will need based on that, multiplied on the number of vials you have.</li><li>Change the tip on the suction, in case someone else used it for some nasty chemical.</li><li>AlkPhos is the best color, but secondary AP-conjugated antibodies from Jackson have some background. Always include “no-primary” and “no-secondary” controls.</li><li>Background in older embryos is from secondary antibody, not endogenous alk-phos or primary antibody. Can reduce amount of secondary.</li><li>For fluorescent detection:<ol><li>1st antibody – use 555 (beautiful red, TRITC)</li><li>2nd antibody – you have a choice: 647 is best, but can’t see it on Nikon (use confocal or Olympus); or, 488, which is green (FITC) and is only good if signal is blazing.</li></ol></li><li>If using HRP antibodies, use TrueBlue or TMB-H instead of DAB for a blue product.</li><li>Stain DNA if desired with Hoechst dye or TO-PRO-3 (depending on wavelength desired) 5’, then wash with PBST a few times.</li><li>Suggested dilutions:<ol><li>DHSB primaries – 1:20 to 1:50</li><li>Secondary antibodies<ol><li>DAB – 1:250 HRP secondaries (Jackson)</li><li>True Blue – 1:750 HRP secondaries (Jackson)</li><li>TMB-H – 1:@ HRP</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></p><p>Materials</p><p>Solutions:<ol><li>PBT: PBS + 2 mg/ml BSA + 0.1% Tween-20 (you will need a lot of PBT, from 1st day).</li><li>PBTr: PBS + 2 mg/ml BSA + 0.1% Triton X-100 (only need a little, on 1st day).</li><li>Stock solutions (store both stocks at -80 ° C):<ol><li>NBT stock: nitro blue tetrazolium<ol><li>75 mg/ml in 70% dimethylformamide</li></ol></li><li>BCIP stock: 5-bromo-4-chloro-indolyl-phosphate<ol><li>50 mg/ml in 100% dimethylformamide for toluidine salt (or in H20 for sodium salt)</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Chromogenic reaction solution:</p><p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Material</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>per 100 ml (make fresh on last day)</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>100 mM Tris (pH 9.5)</p></td><td><p>10 ml of 1 M stock</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>50 mM MgCl2</p></td><td><p>5 ml of 1M stock</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>100 mM NaCl</p></td><td><p>2 ml of 5 M stock</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>0.05% Tween-20</p></td><td><p>0.5 ml of 10% Tween-20</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>5 mM levamisole</p></td><td><p>0.12 g of levamisole powder</p></td></tr></table></li></ol></p><p>Procedure</p><p><ol><li>Fixation:<ol><li>Very cold methanol or formaldehyde (MEMFA)</li><li>For cytoskeleton, use:<ol><li>3% Formaldehyde</li><li>0.2% Glutaraldehyde</li><li>0.2% Triton X-100</li><li>   10 mM EGTA</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Preparation, depending on intended detection method:<ol><li>For fluorescent, need to:<ol><li>Dehydrate with 1X 10’ 50% MeOH, 1X 10’ 100% MeOH, then transfer to fresh 100% MeOH.  Use immediately or store at -20C indefinitely.   NOTE: for samples for paraffin sectioning use EtOH instead. Rehydrate to PBTr.</li><li>Bleach for at least 1 hour in 1% H2O2 in bleaching buffer (5% formamide, 0.5X SSC) on a nutator with bright light.  In most cases you can bleach for longer or with higher H2O2 concentration if your embryos are very pigmented. Always do this step, even for albinos; cut off the heads if possible, because they’ll accumulate bubbles. Better to do longer time and not increase peroxide (otherwise too many bubbles).</li></ol></li><li>For alkaline phosphatase:<ol><li>You need to deactivate endogenous enzyme (comes on at gastrulation or so – don’t need it for cleavage stages).</li><li>Heat in mock hybe solution for 3 hours at 69 °C.</li></ol></li><li>For HRP:<ol><li>Bleach for at least 1 hour in 1% H2O2 in bleaching buffer (5% formamide, 0.5X SSC) on a nutator with bright light. Don’t need to do this on blastomere-stage sections, but definitely do need this for later embryos.</li></ol></li><li>For β-gal, there’s no background!</li><li>For fluorescent, you need to consider autofluorescence:<ol><li>Older frog embryos have autofluorescence in FITC channel</li><li>Glutaraldehyde has fluorescence on all wavelengths, so gel/alb embedded blocks will have bright signal all around</li></ol></li></ol><li>Permeabilize in PBTr for 30 minutes rocking at room temperature.</li><li>Make blocking solution: PBT + 10% heat-inactivated goat serum. Block samples at RT for 1 hour rocking sideways.</li><li>Incubate in primary antibody in fresh block solution overnight at 4° C rocking upright.</li><li>Wash 6X (fill vial each time) with PBT/1h @/RT sideways rocking.</li><li>Make blocking solution: PBT + 10% heat-inactivated goat serum. Block samples at RT for 1 hour rocking sideways.</li><li>Incubate in appropriate secondary antibody overnight at 4° C<ol><li>alk. phos. conjugated goat anti-rabbit (or anti-mouse or whatever) Ig<ol><li>From Jackson ImmunoLabs at 1:1500 or 1:2000, or</li><li>From Rockland (611-105-122) at 1:500 to 1:1000 </li></ol></li><li>Alexafluor-conjugated at 1:500, or</li><li>HRP (Jackson), at 1:250 for DAB detection, or better, 1:750 for TrueBlue detection, and 1:2000 for TMB-H detection</li><li>β-gal-conjugated from SouthernBiotech at (1:500?)</li></ol></li><li>Wash 6X with PBT as in step 6. Last wash should include 0.05 g Levamisole for every 100 ml of PBT, for vials intended for alk-phos detection.</li><li>Chromogenic reaction:<ol><li>AP: wash 2X for 5 min in chromogenic solution (without substrate).  Replace last wash with chromogenic solution + 1 µl NBT solution/ml + 3.5µl BCIP solution/ml.  Put it into cardboard boxes (dark) immediately, and watch the chromogenic reaction periodically; stop it when necessary. Don’t use the ready-made stuff from Rockland/Moss.</li><li>HRP: add direct TMB-H (<a href='http://www.mosssubstrates.com/'>http://www.mosssubstrates.com</a>). Don’t dilute TMB-H – use it straight. This is better than the old way using DAB (brown, toxic). Reaction is not light sensitive! Stop it in 18 MΩ water, and post-fix with @ (Methanol will remove background but eventually also remove signal). Reaction will be complete in < 10 minutes usually; aqua color is often background - real signal is dark purple.</li></ol></li></ol></p><p>This protocol is from <a href='https://drmichaellevin.org/'>Levin laboratory</a> under <a href='https://drmichaellevin.org/people/'>Dr. Michael Levin</a> at <a href='https://as.tufts.edu/biology/people/faculty/michael-levin'>Tufts University</a>.</p>
