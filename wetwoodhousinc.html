    <p>Grow houses from seeds</p><p>Wetwood Housinc bioengineers seeds to grow into houses. We're taking prebuilt houses to the extreme because of the rocket weight problem. Bioengineered seeds take sunlight and other raw material as input and grow into finished houses.</p><p>Plumbing and electrical wiring are like the circulatory and nervous systems.</p><p>Space needs houses that grow according to available raw material on extraterrestrial land. Houses made of living cells. Houses grown, not built. Seeds bioengineered to grow in certain shapes. For scalable housing in Antarctica, space, and other planets.</p>
