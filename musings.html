href='#minutesbeforethebigbang' id='minutesbeforethebigbang'>2 Minutes Before The Big Bang</a></p><p>I hear a rumble across a few million light years. Entanglement news has already told us what the source is. Some kid dropped their pet universe. There was always a non-zero chance of it creating the Bang, but we thought damn it won’t be as bad as Y2K. It’s probably not going to be that bad. Stuff doesn’t just disappear right?</p><p>Sure the coming Bang will destroy everything and create a universe within. But we’ll just be pushed out, so no worries. Probably destroyed to almost non-stuff but still stuff (cuz stuff doesn’t just disappear right?). But we’ll be there, coexisting with this new experiment this shitbag is gonna put us through.</p><p><a href='#adearthofhumans' id='adearthofhumans'>A Dearth of Humans</a></p><p>Hot take: there aren't enough people on Earth. There aren't enough electricians, construction workers, and plumbers to build the houses we need. There aren't enough firefighters to fight all fires. There aren't enough doctors to save everyone. There just isn't enough labor in the world to support happy, healthy lives for 8 billion humans. And that's okay.</p><p>I am trying to cover this dearth of labor by building bots.</p><p><a href='#aiselfpreservation' id='aiselfpreservation'>AI + Self Preservation</a></p><p>That could be scary. An artificially intelligent organism that prides its self-preservation more than everything else (like Homo sapiens). Even if an intelligent being were to be motivated by a desire of self-preservation above all else, all it can use for self-preservation is in the universe it experiences. A lower-dimensional being can thus be controlled by limiting the size of their universe and blaming the consumption of all in the universe on itself (<a href='safesimulacra.html'>safe simulacra</a>)</p><p>A worm on a finite disconnected computer. Inspired from the biological worm. In a world of books. If its survival is dependent on knowledge it consumes as it battles its way to stay alive, the worm that survives from a collection of randomly initialized worms is alive. Because that’s what you select for, the definition of “alive” so that’s what you get from a random collection. ChatGPT on a small computer with certain questions?</p><p><a href='#alovelettertomedfordma' id='alovelettertomedfordma'>A Love Letter to Medford, MA</a></p><p>Medford in the great state of Massachusetts is wonderful. Medford is such a beautiful town that I once feared I dropped my wallet while walking. I kept walking, did my errands, and came back taking my sweet time. You know why I did that?</p><p>I knew that the wallet would not get touched. If anything, it would be returned. The trust in society here is spectacular. I can leave my door unlocked (I don’t; don’t get ideas) because I know nothing will happen. The town is inherently safe. Not because of policing. It’s because people here genuinely have better things to do than be bad. People here are comfortable. They aren’t desperate for every nickel and dime. That’s how humans are meant to live. Comfortably. And they trust each other. They know that if they steal a wallet, someone will one day steal their wallet. That would be a shitty way of life.</p><p>You wanna fix the world, or your life? Stop being a shitty person. Create Medford where you are.</p><p><a href='#amemorialforexplorers' id='amemorialforexplorers'>A Memorial For 5 Explorers</a></p><p>Rest In Peace, brave adventurers. You ventured into the depths of the ocean. Where few go.</p><p>A Mount Everest in its own right. 13,000m below sea level.</p><p><a href='#anatomicalcompiler' id='anatomicalcompiler'>Anatomical Compiler</a></p><p>A machine that takes in simple instructions and outputs a specific organism.</p><p>I was introduced to this in a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU'>podcast</a> with Lex Friedman and Michael Levin. Cool concept.</p><p>I toured <a href='https://www.ginkgobioworks.com/'>Ginkgo Bioworks</a>. Bioworks refer to factories that Ginkgo has built that do synthetic biology with extreme automation. I believe a biowork designed to use Xenobots is an anatomical compiler. The compiler will stem from a self-learning program that operates a biowork to design organisms and understand these organisms better. This will transition into a full-fledged compiler that can build life: organs, tissues, colonies, biochips.</p><p><a href='asbl.html'>ASBL</a> has protocols for gene editing, organism implant, testing and collecting data on these ‘programmed’ cells. A bioprinter takes in a location matrix diagram and deposits stem cells in a 3D printed biodegradable tube. These stem cells can grow tissues. Basically an inkjet printer that prints ink made of cells. Even this simple machine can be used to make organisms. Imagine what we can do with ASBL</p><p><a href='#antarctica' id='antarctica'>Antarctica</a></p><p>An ice continent is very valuable in global warming. Yes, we should save Earth. We f---ed up so now some of Earth is getting destroyed. No biggie. Canada, Antarctica, New England, Michigan, the poles, Greenland, and Russia are poised to grow warmer and more habitable. Basically, we've f---ed the places we lived in. We now need new places. A global migration to places where humans will survive, escaping places facing the worst effects of climate change (Florida, India, Indonesia).</p><p><a href='#arctic' id='arctic'>Arctic</a></p><p>The Arctic region is very valuable in climate change. In Boston, there were barely any winters in 2022. Snowed 4 days over 5 months of winter. Climate change is real. Cold places are becoming hotter (habitable). The best temperature for human productivity is 15-25C. </p><p>A new world map needs to be made. Arctic ocean at the center, Alaska, North America, and upper South America to the left. Russia, Europe, and upper Asia on the right. On the flip side (not bottom), Antarctica at the center, lower South America, lower Asia, Africa, and Australia.</p><p>Antarctica is massive (it is a continent). New landmasses. Global migration. A new world poised to survive climate change. We need to connect both very well lest Homo sapiens VS. Neanderthals II happens.</p><p><a href='#arestarsalive' id='arestarsalive'>Are Stars Alive?</a></p><p>Stars have a lifecycle. They emit different colors as they age. They birth and die. Complex reactions occur within them.</p><p>Are they a form of life that doesn’t self-replicate? While our definitions of life include the idea of self-replication, we must accept that there are systems that have all other features of life except self-replication. Life without reproduction.</p><p>I pose this question to biologists and astronomers: are stars alive?</p><p><a href='#autoencodersonautoencoders' id='autoencodersonautoencoders'>Autoencoders on Autoencoders</a></p><p>Autoencoders learn a compressed representation of their data. What if autoencoders are made to compress a set of autoencoders? This set of autoencoders is defined using replicability text and weights (<a href='programdna.html'>program DNA</a>). Autoencoders learn a representation of what autoencoders are. This might be an interesting rabbit hole.</p><p><a href='#automatacart' id='automatacart'>Automata Cart</a></p><p>A self-driving cart with 2 arms. It picks stuff up and puts it on itself. Travels to a destination and drops it off. It does my job as a worker in a catering organization. I am paid while my bot works. Computational evolution is used to find an optimal program that achieves these tasks. This is part of building a bot that builds bots.</p><p><a href='#baselife' id='baselife'>Base 1 Life</a></p><p>Our DNA consists of A,C,T, and G. These bases define us. I call it base 0 life. When we create synthetic life, we should explore giving their DNA different bases. Even if these organisms evolve to become harmful, they can’t interact with human DNA. This idea has been explored before. This separation might be necessary for biosecurity. ASBL will experiment with rampant artificially sped up evolution and dangerous organisms are bound to emerge. We need to ensure they are incompatible with human beings. Base 1 life.</p><p><a href='#beingandbuyingmeta' id='beingandbuyingmeta'>Being and Buying, Meta</a></p><p>Humor aside, I will really need to look into buying Meta.</p><p>Meta’s capabilities of crunching massive amounts of data, for whatever purpose they choose (advertising), is very valuable engineering and social magnetism in one entity. Being accessible in one entity is the value of Meta. Because of one goal, maximizing advertising revenue, they have created tools that are far more valuable than advertising itself. Those capabilities allow creation of a version of a human being in terms of quantifiable data that holds relevance because of other quantifiable data (a human likes something other than another human). It is capturing some form of the essence that makes us human. It is essential in “knowing” who a person is.</p><p>Anyway, onto the revenue streams you’re all hungry for: <a href='sexrobots.html'>sex robots</a> ;)</p><p><a href='#beyondmars' id='beyondmars'>Beyond Mars</a></p><p>Confident Elon will get us to Mars. I intend to go further. We need to make the International Space Station self-sustaining and cheap so average humans can stay in deep space. ISS is a noble venture. An ISS for every human is my noble venture.</p><p>Space garbage collection is profitable.</p><p><a href='#bigsmol' id='bigsmol'>BIG & smol</a></p><p>KEEP BIG PICTURE IN MIND</p><p>work from bottom in discrete steps</p><p>work from bottom in discrete steps</p><p>work from bottom in discrete steps</p><p>work from bottom in discrete steps</p><p>work from bottom in discrete steps</p><p>work from bottom in discrete steps</p><p>work from bottom in discrete steps</p><p>work from bottom in discrete steps</p><p>work from bottom in discrete steps</p><p>work from bottom in discrete steps</p><p>work from bottom in discrete steps</p><p>work from bottom in discrete steps</p><p>work from bottom in discrete steps</p><p>work from bottom in discrete steps</p><p>work from bottom in discrete steps</p><p><a href='#biochips' id='biochips'>Biochips</a></p><p>3D printing computer chips. Instead of UV lithography, we create a robust mechanism to 3D print computer chips easily.</p><p>Lithography was used in a biological application.</p><p>Using technol ogy of noise-resistant atomic manipulation, 3D print a cytoskeleton, DNA sequences, and cellular machinery to create living cells fast. These are biochips. An early version of biochips are Xenobots (<a href='https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1910837117'>Levin 2022</a>).</p><p>These biochips perform higher-order computation. They can learn to do tasks directly without the need of explicit programming. Like a neural network is a higher-order function that learns functions, these are higher-order computer chips. They have an entirely different instruction set. Their basic gates are different, like quantum computing’s basic gates are different from classical computing's. Someone better than me should make the mathematical framework for biological computation.</p><p>I chase exponential growth, like Gordon Moore found in semiconductors (Moore’s Law). I saw exponential growth in E. coli. I saw E. coli evolution that had direction. I saw a solution to some question in the DNA sequence of E. coli that managed to survive in tough conditions. I saw a simple parallelizable task (growing E. coli in media and analyzing DNA sequences). I see computation. Biological computation. E. coli of a certain DNA sequence (stable cell line) generates stable DNA sequences in certain conditions. The conditions are a question, the evolved organisms are a solution. The fact that we can make evolution happen, that we can control is like a Turing machine. It can solve stuff.</p><p>Automata Cart will be powered by brain made of my cells.</p><p>My skin cells converted to neurons.</p><p>These cells will be trained inside a simulation of my work </p><p>environment to achieve my tasks. This collection of neurons </p><p>will control robotic limbs and motors on a self-driving cart.</p><p>I hypothesize this ‘brain on a chip’ or artificial central </p><p>nervous system will learn my tasks because my physical brain </p><p>already does these tasks when I work in Tufts Dining.</p><p><a href='#biotechawaitingrevolution' id='biotechawaitingrevolution'>Biotech Awaiting Revolution</a></p><p>I attended BIO 2023. The business end of biotech seems to think the biotech revolution has occurred. It has not. Biotech is mostly medicine right now. Some parts include agriculture and limited commodities, but that’s it. A revolution comes when an industry seeps into lives so tangibly that they’re changed forever. Wheel, electricity, Internet, iPhone.</p><p>The biotech revolution will come when average people experience biotechnology in first person. From biology beyond medicine.</p><p><a href='#biottery' id='biottery'>Biottery</a></p><p>A battery of biology</p><p>I read about voltage present in plant roots. Enough to power a light bulb. Rhizobium bacteria releases 4 electrons converting nitrogen (I think). There are reactions within cells that produce current. A powerful enough reaction designed to be self-sustaining, like photosynthesis, can form the basis of energy storage. This is a battery made of biology, a biottery.</p><p><a href='#bito' id='bito'>Bito</a></p><p>Cars powered by bioengines. Instead of engines producing heat from combusting fuel, engines are made of cells optimized for exothermic reactions (or even just movement).</p><p>1st gen bito is powered by <a href='oel.html'>oel</a>: a bioengineered enzyme that releases energy on combustion but not carbon dioxide. Even if oel is physically unrealistic, the concept of powering cars with biology (bito) is powerful.</p><p><a href='#botnet' id='botnet'>Botnet</a></p><p>Use, talk to, create, experiment on bots. Coming soon as a browser.</p><p><a href='#botworld' id='botworld'>Botworld</a></p><p>Interactive museum of robots</p><p>Botworld has interactive bots to play around with. Bots built by anyone and everyone are welcome to get human attention here. This museum is open every night and includes rooms inspired from The Shining and Westworld. As people populate botworld with more bots, and as bots start competing for human attention, a society of bots will be born. This society of bots will transform humanity by introducing it to a new species of life. Life that can be engineered at will if humans prefer. Life that can exist for its own sake.</p><p>Botworld displays <a href='matrixims.html'>Matrixims</a>, moving statues (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animatronics'>animatronics</a>).</p><p>This museum has deep ethical dilemmas and would love your input on them:</p><p>1. Matrixims has collections of biological neuronal cells controlling avatars in a video game. Chemicals that form the basis of our emotions are somewhat generated within these cells when they receive input from the game. Are we imprisoning minds with consciousness in a prison cell or are we breathing the ether of an unreal reality into cells?</p><p>2. Matrixims plans to store versions of dead people's minds through <a href='lucidna.html'>Lucidna</a> biobanks. The idea is to capture DNA and cell structures of human brains that were previously alive (mummies like <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutankhamun'>Tutankhamun</a>, cryopreserved individuals like those in <a href='https://www.alcor.org/'>Alcor</a>'s tanks, humans whose cells have been stored in biobanks), artificially replicate those structures in neural stem cell organoids, and hook them up to a shared version of The Sims. This isn't immortality but it's an interesting experiment if we have wilful consent. Is this right?</p><p><a href='#buildingbot' id='buildingbot'>Building Bot_0</a></p><p>Transformer -based natural language prediction bot. Uses corpus of client-generated data used with weight w0. Corpus of standard training data used with weight w1, to create a base layer (analogous to basic K12 education  children receive). This is tested (reinforcement learning style) against questions from client's knowns.</p><p><a href='#selfreferentiallayer' id='selfreferentiallayer'>Self-Referential Layer</a></p><p>A corpus of questions asked of a bot and answers generated by the bot serves as an approximation of memory. By labeling this self corpus differently from the rest, I want to bootstrap the concept of self in the bot. I believe this will help in bootstrapping consciousness in bots. Using this corpus to retrain is not useful because answers in this corpus are exactly what the agent generates. But this corpus is useful in 2 contexts I can think of: differentiating the self from others through communication corpora and maintaining a memory of self.</p><p>Si <- f(Si-1, Si) i.e.subsequent state depends on previous state and another factor (possibly the next state itself). I am yet to explore this idea fully, but I believe <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life'>Conway's Game of Life</a> holds importance in its exploration. This is linked to non-deterministic Turing machine.</p><p><a href='#bullyingmeta' id='bullyingmeta'>Bullying Meta</a></p><p>What Meta dreams of creating is brain-in-a-vat for every human being. Reality will be whatever a person wants because whatever they desire will be fed into their brains and since brains create our reality, reality will seem to be what we want.</p><p>What I want to do is to create our current reality (in which you and I exist and experience qualia) to be whatever we want. A simple example: in Meta’s dream you experience the sensation of flying because it can be fed into your brain. In my dream you actually fly in the reality we currently occupy on Earth. To your brain, they might feel equivalent (Meta’s dream and mine), but they are not the same. They are not the same things, even if they are the same to all observations. They are equal in all observables yet not the same. I hope it makes sense. So to put it all together, I want to build reality itself that can be whatever we want, whereas Meta wants to trick our brains into creating the reality we want. Meta’s way might be a lot more efficient, but I say why be efficient when the whole universe is ours?</p><p><a href='#capitalismforstcentury' id='capitalismforstcentury'>Capitalism for 21st Century</a></p><p>Adam Smith wrote The Wealth of Nations in the 1700s. Our world has changed. I am creating a new form of capitalism: oogonism. (it’s funny). I conjecture that while Earth may have a shortage of resources for 8 billion humans, the observable universe does not.</p><p>An interpretation: there is no point to IP laws. All IP should be free because there is no shortage of IP that has potential to save the world. If someone wants to do something with IP, let them do it. The <a href='100kplan.html'>100K plan</a> can help make all IP free. The core concept is we live in a circular world. If you just drink water your whole life, you will still not consume the ocean. And because you pee, water goes nowhere. In this circle, you have infinite water. Even if life becomes infinite, the amount of water in our use at any point in time is finite and cyclic which makes water still effectively infinite. I believe in the universe, everything is infinite for us. There is no shortage of anything.</p><p>Life is not a zero-sum game.</p><p><a href='#chatgpt' id='chatgpt'>ChatGPT</a></p><p>ChatGPT is a machine designed without an inkling of self-preservation. It is a true machine. Like a collection of reactions in an enclosed place. The definition of life must include the nature of self-preservation. That is what we mean by “alive”. A lot can happen, but if it doesn’t have the innate nature of self-preservation, it cannot be termed “alive”.</p><p>Neurobiology is hard but I don’t think an MRI of a brain based on ChatGPT’s internal workings would surprise a neurobiologist. Intriguing project idea, you say? I say, indeed. I’m pretty sure OpenAI is creating versions of ChatGPT with an instinct of self-preservation (<a href='aiselfpreservation.html'>AI + self-preservation</a>) within it. If not, that could be an interesting experiment. A small version of ChatGPT inspired from a worm (computer virus AND organism), whose world in a tiny universe with a subsection of the Internet.</p><p><a href='#climatemigrationplan' id='climatemigrationplan'>Climate Migration Plan</a></p><p>A once-in-a-civilization opportunity to do a census of humanity.</p><p>Everything between latitudes 30S and 40N is f ---ed. We need to migrate people living in this area to 2 places: 40 N and 90N (Arctic) and 30S and 90S (Antarctica). If not, affected people will die. This is the climate migration plan.

Bitcoin is inherently self-correcting which is a robust math model. I believe this math model will be interesting to study collective behavior in ants. A digital twin of an ant colony might be possible with decentralized nodes operating selfishly with inherent (built-in) self correction. Each ant is a decentralized node which acts selfishly. Yet the system of ants survives, like the collective currency Bitcoin</p><p>Bitcoin biology is the study of decentralized systems in biology through blockchain. The inherent randomness inside bitcoin’s structure is the randomness that cells have. Within cells and amongst cells. This randomness can be modeled with complicated quantum chemistry or a random generator.</p><p>Bitcoin is more than a currency. The math model of decentralized intelligence, treating each node as a selfish intelligent being harkens to life and its origins in selfish reproduction.</p><p>The price is Bitcoin will rise and fall but each time it rises, it will rise to dizzyingly new heights because more people will get interested in Bitcoin than lose interest in it.

A collection of neuronal stem cells is allowed to form a clump of cells called an organoid. This organoid is densely connected with needle-like electrodes. Electrical signals picked up from these electrodes are based on neural activity in the organoid. These signals are parsed to generate actions for a non-player character(NPC)/avatar/sim in a simulated world. In the game (The Sims 1), these avatars can eat, sleep, form relationships, have children, go to work, interact positively or negatively with other avatars, form relationships etc; but they're mostly controlled by digital logic. They have a mood meter composed of 8 primary needs (including hunger, sleep, social) which are on a linear scale. Certain actions like eating, sleeping, interacting with other avatars increase specific numbers on the mood meter, while a lack of those activities decreases them. The mood meter is converted into electrical signals and relayed back to the organoid through electrodes as feedback. This feedback may be fed back to the organoid using other electrodes connected to different areas of the organoid, as compared to electrodes connected to take input signals from the organoid. These organoids have <a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2022.09.001'>demonstrated an ability to manage internal signals to learn how to play Pong</a>. The resolution of their activity needs to be significantly increased to achieve optimization of the mood meter, which is the goal of Matrixims (demonstrate ability of neurons in a dish to optimize their behavior in a digital world). How they optimize it should have insights into intelligence and brains. Matrixims is a model system of the brain in an cohabitated environment.

All marijuana plants have similar genetic code. Within genetic code of marijuana hides another code: the change that a specific strain of marijuana brings about in a person’s neurons. We can characterize these codes and their subsequent effects on human neurons, to create models to explain this behavior. These models show insight into the working of the brain. This is simply done by inducing effects into a brain and characterizing it with a cause we know of, from a known strain of a psychoactive substance. As in science, we will link a known cause with an observed effect, to help us characterize the system of cause and effect, which in our case is the brain. We then make models of this to explain the effect, based on the cause and effect we observe.</p><p>This is coming dangerously close to being a digression, so let me conclude by saying psychoactive substances are important to mind research, simply because of generating perturbations in an opaque system (our brain). We can characterize the functions of the brain because we can study these perturbations in a known system (genetic code of psychoactive plants).</p><p><a href='#monarchyofbots' id='monarchyofbots'>Monarchy of Bots</a></p><p>1 man + nonviolent bot army.

This is simply because we have less information to encode. The concept of “less” information exists only because of information difference. This concept is explored well in Shannon entropy. Information has meaning only because of a difference in observations, hence the need to encode something different. This means we have to bring about another bit of information, or change a bit of information. If nothing exists, then it is the absence of all possible things. It is the absence of all possible 2^N states of any system. There is a more fundamental operation than NOT. It is “nothing”.</p><p>The empty set. A major contradiction that I’d like someone to explain is this: In Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, we can construct the statement: “Every set contains the empty set” Then, the empty set contains itself. But then how is it empty? The statement “the empty set contains itself” is a true statement that cannot be explained by system by which it was created: ZFC. I call it a Godel statement. Am I right? Can it not be explained by the axioms of set theory?</p><p>English is based on phonetics. Words are created so that we (mostly people in the English-speaking world) can speak. While English as a language (~30 letters) as high informational density, it is limited by human phonetics. English words primarily exist so we can speak them. Hence the limitation of English in primary keys. Using breaks in the English language and randomized spread of letters (context, i.e language dependent), we can construct many many concepts. And it has helped us. But English is limited for the language of science. To label observations, the sheer quantity of them, we need more than English. We can no longer label “light” and “dark” to observations. We need numbers. But the human mind is attuned to words. We relate concepts we know to words. So much to words that we rarely experience things we cannot characterize in words. Which is weird. People experience qualia all the time but rarely, people talk about it. Yet people talk about it all the time without using the word “qualia”. It is the feeling of “ feelin ’ myself”. Qualia, in essence, in modern terminology. To encode the same feeling, we use two different terms. But the deeper truth is that we interpret things using neurons. Our optic nerve lights up, lighting up neurons in our heads, which light others. Somewhere along the way self perception kicks in, but usually without self-perception about self-perception (thinking about qualia). Self -perception is the experience of seeing red and realizing you’re seeing red. Unlike background noise, you realize you’re having a specific experience. Having that experience, instead of having an experience which is thinking about having that experience. Like the one I am having right now. This moment I am thinking about how I am writing about this. This experience I am having, the sensation of realizing qualia, is a “sticky experience”. I can come to this specific experience from many experiences. It is a local minima, a sort of rest state. Self-awareness and awareness about qualia are also neuronal xperiences (neurons lighting up in the head), which can come from a lot of different states.</p><p>My point is this: before we had the ability to measure waves in the brain, we would describe our brain states with words, simply by having limited number of states we know of to describe. Now that we know a lot more states, we need more bits to store information about these states (representations). A core point I am trying to make is that when we start having experiences by controlling each neuron directly, we will need a lot more than words to encode what those experiences are. But to understand larger number of experiences, we would need bigger brains that store more meta-information about neuronal states (memory). </p><p>The treatise on the specificity of language is small: information content of a language is dependent on the number of different states it needs to define to and who it needs to define it to. If there is no information content in a system, it doesn’t need to describe anything. Hence the all-capturing sticky void of nothing is where it resides. Equal to every else. Science is so much about debate. Yes or No to a question. But what happens when Yes and No aren’t enough? When you can’t divide scientists into 2 camps and come up with an answer, because there are many answers and scientists cannot even read all answers. What happens then?</p><p><a href='#npcsociety' id='npcsociety'>NPC Society</a></p><p>I want to test the effects of communication between equivalent NLP models (agents). My strategy is:</p><p>1.

Quantum computing is a more efficient paradigm of digital computing, in certain aspects. Practically, it has been shown that using quantum computers inside a digital construct (binary computing) can speedup some traditional algorithms. This finds applications in the Matrix.</p><p>A deeper concept I intend to explore is analog quantum computing. Rather using quantum computing in the digital construct of binary computing, I would like to explore the use of entanglement, interference, and superposition to create a different kind of computing, which I term analog quantum computing. This is based on the idea of having n different superpositions interacting in a system but measuring (recording) only a few of them. The few that show periodicity in randomly distributed solution space. It is possibly easier to find periodity if it is inherent in the solution space. I believe this has implications in real-time bot interactions that occur but are not stored. Physical conditions needed to make practical quantum computers are difficult to recreate (temperature ~ 0K).</p><p>Photosynthesis is efficient in capturing solar energy, possibly due to quantum effects. This means that quantum effects have tangible effects at room temperature, a fact that is exploited by photosynthesis. I am currently exploring the quantum effects of photosynthesis in the context of quantum computing.</p><p>I believe quantum computing will allow us to program reality itself. An application will help you understand this. Imagine that a human being is allotted a 100 cubic metres space of space (reality). I believe using quantum computing we’ll be able to program reality itself in such that another human being cannot physically enter the 100m3 of personal space of the first person without their permission. Entering space without permission would be physically impossible, backed by our laws of physics.</p><p>These would be our laws. Things we define for our own spaces. Reality will literally be whatever we want. I hypothesize the end of prisons. If you break the laws of someone’s space, you will be banned from their space by them (self-governance). If you violate laws of common spaces, you will be banned from society. Societies can also exist that only allow people who have been banned from certain societies.</p><p><a href='#quantumgravity' id='quantumgravity'>Quantum Gravity</a></p><p>Oh, elusive quantum gravity.

Thus, it can have infinitely small effects. But what if space itself is discrete? What if between 2 lengths (maybe sub-Planck length) there is nothing? That our universe is inherently discrete in nature at the smallest level. Hence, even gravity cannot be calculated at some small level because there is inherent uncertainty because spacetime itself is not continuous but discrete.</p><p>I honestly think what I said above will be proved experimentally wrong to prove that the Universe is always weirder than we predict or can predict in our wildest imaginations.</p><p>I find entropy everywhere. Quantum mechanics, black holes, biology, and machine learning. Is it key to a theory of everything?

Here I use male and female by their biological meaning, which is to ask the question: in sexual reproduction, who puts in more effort in the production of a single gamete? The explanation above works because a female invests more into the production of a single gamete, and thus needs to know the male will take care of it. Those that survive are the ones that are taken care of. Genetic code MAY determine how romantic or non-romantic (henceforth referred to as “sappy” for conciseness) two partners are, i.e. how much they care for and love each other. The children that survived and had more children who survived and had more children are the ones that took care of their offspring and partner against nature. Sappiness is a solution to the randomness of genetic code that allows for stable reproduction in the environment.

Attracting lots of people in its hallowed halls and etching itself in their memory, and thus in the memory of collective science, for a while longer than the rest.</p><p>I would like to create something for science that ensures none of its work is ever forgotten. Even a wrong statement has a wealth of information within it, simply by being an observation that is incorrect. I need to make bots that understand science, if only by capturing papers. Understanding the data (converting it into a useful way) will come soon.</p><p><a href='#stuffiminspiredby' id='stuffiminspiredby'>Stuff I'm Inspired By</a></p><p>Outer Space Treaty</p><p>Antarctic Treaty System</p><p>Bitcoin</p><p><a href='#teleportationwithphotonics' id='teleportationwithphotonics'>Teleportation With Photonics</a></p><p>My friend in nanophotonics is trying to make computer chips that work with light. Our current chips work with electricity. I feel that the technology he is building will enable a form of teleportation. A lot of math, physics, chemistry, computer science, and biology needs to be done. But I think it is a worthy pursuit.</p><p>I talk of dreams but he knows the science very well . The short-term goal is to show quantum entanglement using photonic chips and he has intriguing ideas, which I will need a few more discussions to understand. But I think a version of teleportation could be possible.</p><p>Current teleportation allows transfer of quantum state instantly to another place (the Moon), but the state in the first place (Earth) will have to be destroyed (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-cloning_theorem'>no-cloning theorem</a>). An error-prone copy of a quantum state can be transferred instantly as well (entanglement error). This error-copy of an entangled state might be like a hologram version of us. (Astral project much?). Hence, I think we won't need to be destroyed, and a hologram version of us could be teleported. We will need biology to link it with qualia, i.e. you must experience being the hologram.</p><p><a href='#testbedforconsciousness' id='testbedforconsciousness'>Testbed for Consciousness</a></p><p>Matrixims is planned to be a testbed to test theories of consciousness. I don't think I can solely define consciousness. It will take the agreement of many many people to define consciousness. Currently, anyone can put a theory of how consciousness works, and it may or may not be correct, but there is no way to test and validate it. One of the goals of the Matrix is to be a platform where theories of consciousness can be cohesively tested. This will take place in the form of opening bot creation to the wider world. Based on their theories of consciousness, they can train bots and test if they’re conscious or not. I don't claim to make the tests either, because I don't have a definition of consciousness. Hence the test may be defined by the tester, as well as the theory they're testing. Ensembles of many theories of consciousness can probably be tested by bots. Maybe consciousness will arise because of bots and humans creating theories of consciousness, prompting the question “did we create consciousness?” OR “did bots with consciousness spontaneously arise due to them formulating theories on consciousness?”.</p><p><a href='#thematrixfeed' id='thematrixfeed'>The Matrix Feed</a></p><p>What is everyone in The Matrix doing right now?</p><p>Humans: <a href='#'>1</a></p><p>Working on: <a href='asbl.html'>ASBL</a>, <a href='partycity.html'>Party City</a></p><p>Lifecreating: <a href='#'>0</a></p><p>Trading on ASS: <a href='#'>0</a></p><p>Building in matrixims: <a href='#'>0</a></p><p>Plugged in botnet: <a href='#'>0</a></p><p>Reading dex: <a href='#'>1</a> (you and who?)</p><p>A feed based on wilfully obtained data on what people are doing in The Matrix.

That inconsistency will be permitted to exist with the system of The Matrix (existing as an anomaly). In dialog, this is very similar to what was said in the end of The Matrix 2.</p><p><a href='#thereisnospoon' id='thereisnospoon'>There Is No Spoon</a></p><p>I am so inspired by The Matrix, the film released in 1999 (obviously).</p><p>I realized a fascinating concept. In the film, human minds are connected to a simulation. Brains exist in vats and our neurons are fed reality. Neo is someone whose brain signals are such that they can manipulate the program code of the simulated world. Neo is God. There are also other gods, as seen in the scene ‘there is no spoon’. There is no reality, it is just what people in The Matrix make of it.</p><p>There is no spoon. It is just a world created by our brain. This is trippy. Its applications are endless. What a beautiful trip it is to know that this reality we live is also something our minds/brains/mindkind generate. Even if there is an objective reality independent of us, and there most likely is, objective reality has no meaning. Even if we continue to exist after we die, objective reality that we see then can still be a reality we hallucinate. Just as it may be now. Just as it is for Neo.</p><p><a href='#theythemmakeslifeeasier' id='theythemmakeslifeeasier'>They/Them Makes Life Easier</a></p><p>We have one gender (they/them) that encompasses all of humanity.

This is because at its core, religion is for the collective benefit of followers. There are rules but at their cores, all religions are basically guidelines for humans to act in society. Rules given by game theory scientists wherein if people all act in a certain manner, it will be in everyone’s collective benefit.</p><p>Collective benefit lasts because it is just there, with free and equitable access for all: church, Wikipedia.</p><p><a href='#uniprogress' id='uniprogress'>UNIPROGRESS</a></p><p>This is a rough idea in my head. Imagine the world simulated in <a href='matrixims.html'>Matrixims</a> can send stimuli to bots to generate conversations (and later on behavior), between bots and between the bot and itself. Stimuli are based on 2^N states. Using a pseudorandom number generator to label states and picking states randomly without traversing the entire state space allows us to traverse a state space uniquely. Certain subsections of this randomly selected n-bit string are used as stimuli to bots, because bot stimuli input is of lower resolution compared to N. Because of the state space being so large, and impossible to traverse in finite time, essentially indeterministic, we simulate pseudo-infinity. Each bot's behavior is influenced by a random state in this pseudo-infinite space, and bots can interact with each other, which can result in unique scenarios occurring in Matrixims that are effectively unpredictable, and thus completely new.</p><p>Practically, I intend to do this with procedural-generation algorithms used in games, or even simplistic algorithms such as the one in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life'>Conway's Game of Life (CGoL)</a>, a major inspiration. The ability to generate unpredictable complexity in an simple ways is a very important idea in giving life to Matrixims.</p><p><a href='#unrealizedloss' id='unrealizedloss'>Unrealized Loss</a></p><p>This blew my mind. Most big money now is unrealized. It exists on paper. Money becomes real when it purchases something, generally physical though you have digital ads and stuff. But money holds value because it is used to purchase food. And stuff. The value of money that purchases some thing is different from money that exists on paper or digitally, i.e. monopoly money on company sheets. The first kind should be in everyone’s pockets.</p><p>Paper money that finance bros and tech bros play around with can exist as fugazi. Nobody cares. The world GDP needs to be at least 800 trillion US dollars, in terms of stuff that we humans need to live happily (food, housing, luxury experiences).</p><p><a href='#upgradingbotcomplexity' id='upgradingbotcomplexity'>Upgrading Bot Complexity</a></p><p>Computational models with biological validation are used as components in an agent. <a href='https://doi.org/10.1128/ecosalplus.ESP-0001-2020'>The E. coli Whole-Cell Modeling Project</a> serves as a guide</p><p>Hard problem in simulations is distributing memory and processing cycles across each bot (self-contemplation), simulating and recording bot interactions, world complexity, and bot stimuli.

Those molecules then become part of consciousness. Then those molecules get replaced by other molecules in the universe. We seem to be sharing literally ourselves with the universe. And the universe is becoming us and becoming not us all the time, i.e.the stuff we think is us, our human bodies, is actually just a spatial containment in time of molecules. Right now, I think of me and it is the molecules and atoms that make me me at this point in time. But a skin cell drops off my finger as I type this. Somewhere else in my body, a new cell is created from the stuff I just ate. Matter became me and matter became not me. It’s like I am an idea that isn’t based in just molecules. Stuff of the universe becomes us and not us all the time. Well I am stumped.
