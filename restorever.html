    <h1>RESTOREVER</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Restore climate</p><p>Restorever is a firm established to restore Earth's climate. Restorever combats climate change with engineering. Decades of climate abuse for profit by nations and corporations caused climate change, destroying natural ecosystems and innate restorative mechanisms of Nature. Groundwater abuse destroyed soil quality, excessive combusion heated seas and polluted air, and deforestation eliminated natural defenses against soil erosion. Restorever has programs listed below to restore groundwater, defend against hurricanes, and reverse air pollution.</p><p><a href='#freshwatershipping'>Freshwater Shipping</a><br><a href='#hurricanedefense'>Hurricane Defense</a><br><a href='#fightforourlungs'>Fight For Our Lungs</a><br><a href='#about'>About</a><br><a href='mailto:manonthemoon13131@gmail.com'>Contact</a>  (manonthemoon13131@gmail.com)</p><p><a href='#freshwatershipping' id='freshwatershipping'>Freshwater Shipping</a> is a division of Restorever to ship freshwater from melting glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica. Restorever glacier water is available as cargo tanker shipments or bottled water.</p><p>Current available supply: 150,000 tons per week (150,000,000 L)<br>Annual water subscription: 7.8 million tons per year (7,800,000,000 L)<br>Total available supply (pipeline): 20 billion tons per year (20,000,000,000,000 L)</p><p>Restorever is contracted to restore dry rivers, fill hydroelectric dams and lakes, build artificial rivers, stockpile strategic water reserves, recharge groundwater, and provide drinking water in citywide tap supply. We have partners in Greenland with licenses to ship 20 billion tons of freshwater annually. An unprecedented volume of water is available. This water is suitable for drinking with minimal filtration, agriculture, and industrial purposes.</p><p><a href='#hurricanedefense' id='hurricanedefense'>Hurricane Defense</a> is a division in Restorever to combat hurricanes by disrupting hurricane formation. Hurricanes are formed over seawater from rising moist air from hot sea surfaces, generating thunderstorms with a low pressure center and low vertical wind shear. Hurricanes require the Coriolis force for formation. Hurricanes are exacerbated by rising sea surface temperatures caused by climate change.</p><p>Hurricane Defense is conducting a feasibility study on hurricane disruption using <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics'>computational fluid dynamics</a> (<a href='https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2310.03350'>1</a>). This report will inform further experimental tests with the permission of relevant government agencies. Each hurricane causes $100-120 billion in damages, evident in hurricanes <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Milton'>Milton</a> (2024) and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Helene'>Helene</a> (2024) in USA. Restorever aims to charge $1 billion per hurricane to defend nations against them.</p><p><a href='#fightforourlungs' id='fightforourlungs'>Fight For Our Lungs</a> is a campaign started by Restorever in Delhi, India on 26 November 2024 to restore air quality in Delhi. Air pollution is severe in Delhi. Air Quality Index is in 400-500 range in 2024-2025 winters. Restorever is engineering solutions to restore air quality in Delhi. There is a layer of smog stuck in Delhi skies, visible in flight descent. It is stuck due to lack of wind.</p><p>Fight For Our Lungs has the following steps: declaration of public health emergency, atmospheric vacuum cleaner to clear smog, large wind farms to generate wind, mass outmigration to alleviate population density burden, and pandemic-like shutdown of work and transport. Support our campaign by emailing the Chief Minister of Delhi, <a href='mailto:cmdelhi@nic.in'>Atishi Marlena</a>, and the Minister for Environment of Delhi, <a href='mailto:gopalrai.delhi@delhi.gov.in'>Gopal Rai</a>.</p><p><a href='#about' id='about'>About</a><br>Restorever began to secure long-term water supply for <a href='asbl.html'>ASBL</a>. <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/noorulali'>Noorul Ali</a> (founder and CEO) saw additional revenue sources created by globally dwindling freshwater supplies and desalination toxicity. Restorever restores the climate with engineering. Repurposing melting glaciers combats rising sea levels implicated in deadly hurricanes (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Milton'>Milton</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Helene'>Helene</a>, USA 2024) and floods (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Spanish_floods'>Spanish floods</a> 2024). Restorever is engineering solutions to restore air quality in the founder's hometown, Delhi. Restorever combats hurricanes by exploring options to disrupt hurricane formation before landfall. Restorever is an expensive firm to contract. Decades of climate profiteering led to climate destruction. Restorever restores the climate. Much damage is done and it is expensive to restore the climate.</p><p><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/company/restorever'>LinkedIn</a></p>
