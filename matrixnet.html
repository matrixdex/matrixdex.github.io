    <h1>MATRIXNET</h1>
    <br>
    <p>New internet</p><p>Matrixnet is an Internet built in 2025 governed by <a href='index.html'>The Matrix</a>. Matrixnet user devices are the servers powering Matrixnet.</p><p><a href='#about'>About</a><br><a href='#bitcoinbanking'>Matrixnet Bitcoin Bank</a><br><a href='#botnet'>Botnet</a><br><a href='#controlledaccess'>Controlled access</a><br><a href='#dexnet'>Dexnet</a><br><a href='#matrixnetemail'>Matrixnet spam-free email</a><br><a href='#newusers'>New users</a><br><a href='#personaldatabank'>Personal Databank</a></p><p><a href='#about' id='about'>About</a><br>Matrixnet is a retreat into the original vision of the Internet, now referred to as Web 1.0. Matrixnet destroys the idea of large corporations controlling the Internet. Before 2025, large swathes of the Internet were controlled by large corporations like Google, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft. These corporations relied on advertisements to generate revenue. They made the Internet a cesspool of spam ads, data theft, and made privacy a joke. Matrixnet rebukes the Internet of 2024.</p><p><a href='#bitcoinbanking' id='bitcoinbanking'>Matrixnet Bitcoin Bank</a><br>Matrixnet is ad-free and generates revenue from commissions on payments powered by its Bitcoin-based bank, Matrixnet Bitcoin Bank (Matrixbank). Each Matrixnet user has a digital bank account to store Bitcoin. Matrixbank guarantees 1 BTC for each user annually. A user can pay up to 10 million finney to other users on credit from Matrixbank every year. Each payment of n finney using Matrixbank carries a note: Matrixnet Bitcoin Bank guarantees the receiver of this transaction n finney. Matrixbank gives liquidity to holders of Bitcoin with its trusted payment network, enabled by <a href='#controlledaccess'>controlled access</a>. Controlled access is Matrixbank's KYC (know-your-customer).</p><p><a href='#botnet' id='botnet'>Botnet</a><br>Botnet is a browser for Matrixnet. Botnet accesses a network of bots like browsers access the Internet, a network of websites. Each bot in Botnet has a chatbot interface. Matrixnet users build API backends for services provided by companies such as travel booking, web hosting, and more. A service bot accesses relevant API backends to perform tasks. Each bot in Botnet takes text and GUI input.</p><p>Botnet plans for apps, websites, and other media to be generated and rendered natively in a device-independent manner. Device independence is achieved through a new CPU architecture developing in <a href='cnsrobots.html'>CNS Robots</a>.</p><p>For example, Expedia's chatbot books flight tickets from text input (book flight from Delhi to London on 25 January). Botnet accesses your data from <a href='#personaldatabank'>Personal Databank</a> to fill information like your name, passport number, visa validity, phone number, email, and payment details. When you give consent to book a ticket, Botnet accesses your data on PDB for a limited period of time, gives data to Expedia's bot which books the ticket, gives your payment information to Stripe's bot, and name, email, and travel itinerary to United Airlines' bot. These bots exist in a society of bots called Botnet, and work together to book your ticket with minimal manual input from you.</p><p>Build these bots for Botnet:<br>Tufts bot prints IDs, reserves rooms, does payroll, gets college news, and applies to on-campus jobs, all in a clean text format.<br>News bot delivers news to you, powered by a public ranked forum where truth is verified using votes. Think ETH staking but with credibility for news sources (humans, news channels, Big News). Trust rankings determine what news gets to you.<br>Flight bot books cheap flights in text. No need to navigate different websites and find the best price, let it book tickets and send them to you.<br>Jobs bot connects to universities to verify degrees, connects to <a href='researchengine.html'>research engine</a> to verify letters of recommendation, and autofills job applications based on skill relevance.</p><p><a href='#controlledaccess' id='controlledaccess'>Controlled access</a><br>The crux of Matrixnet is controlled access. Getting access to Matrixnet is a difficult task. Only authorized humans can give new users access to Matrixnet. Currently, only the founder Noorul Ali authorizes new users. Controlled access powers all Matrixnet apps like <a href='#bitcoinbanking'>Bitcoin bank</a>, <a href='#matrixnetemail'>Matrixnet Email</a>, <a href='#botnet'>Botnet</a>, and <a href='#dexnet'>Dexnet</a>. Controlled access is the key behind spam elimination that makes Matrixnet a clean new Internet.</p><p><a href='#dexnet' id='dexnet'>Dexnet</a><br>Dexnet is a collection of dexs built by dexweb. Each dex is a programmatically generated text-only website. Dexnet collects dexs in a public list for people read freely. Dexnet contains research journals, company financial reports, personal journals, and more.</p><p><a href='#matrixnetemail' id='matrixnetemail'>Matrixnet Email</a><br>Matrixnet eliminates spam using 3-way handshakes ensuring people have the right to revoke access to them on Matrixnet. This is to be implemented first in Matrixnet Email. An identification system generates tokens necessary for access to inbox, inspired by cookie-based identification. Spam is eliminated by revoking access to tokens.</p><p><a href='#newusers' id='newusers'>New users</a> get a <a href='#bitcoinbanking'>Matrixbank</a> bank account, their dex hosted on <a href='#dexnet'>Dexnet</a>, and an email account in <a href='#matrixnetemail'>Matrixnet</a> Email. They are officially members of <a href='index.html'>The Matrix</a>.</p><p><a href='#personaldatabank' id='personaldatabank'>Personal Databank</a><br>Personal Databank (PDB) is a device to store all your data in your home. Time-scrambled data are released from PDB based on wilful consent. PDB is a device sold as an appliance. It connects to all state machines in a spatial box (physical house). It backs up all data. PDB is linked to every laptop, phone, TV, fridge, autokitchen, IoT device, garage door, and appliance in a household. PDB stores all kinds of data for each unique individual in the house, in a contaminant-free manner (users can only access and release their data, no central control over all data). It lets out time-scrambled data to services only till they need them. For example, Doordash and Amazon only need location when an order is placed. Controlled data release based on user preference enforces consent and privacy.</p><p>A PDB usecase is <a href='thematrixfeed.html'>The Matrix Feed</a> which collates some data into a webpage showing what logged in users in The Matrix are doing. Trading on <a href='antarcticstocksimulation.html'>Antarctic Stock Simulation</a>, building worlds in <a href='matrixims.html'>Matrixims</a>, creating life using <a href='asbl.html'>ASBL</a> machines, reading dexs on <a href='#dexnet'>Dexnet</a> or building bots on <a href='#botnet'>Botnet</a>.</p><p>Data can be processed to find mates for people, like personal Tinder. Dystopian we know, but why must it be so? You are encouraged to meet people in real life. You simply have a choice to take advantage of large-scale statistics to help you choose a mate. Reiterating choice: you are free to not partake in data-based love search. That is the point of Personal Databank. You control where your data are used.</p><p>Each PDB is yours. Owned by you. Truly and completely owned by you. Tear it up, break it apart, or re-engineer it entirely. You might get a call of The Matrix if you make it better. Matrixnet owns nothing of a Personal Databank it has already sold, including its software. PDB software is owned by users and not simply licensed like most software. You can modify it. Matrixnet provides services so databanks can operate and we incorporate that in our (high) price. But the databank and all data in it are yours. We have no right, no access over it, and this is verified by others (<a href='algobank.html'>Algobank</a>). If you choose to give us some of your data, we'll incorporate it in different parts of The Matrix like <a href='matrixims.html'>Matrixims</a>, <a href='thematrixfeed.html'>The Matrix Feed</a>, and <a href='lucidna.html'>Lucidna</a>.</p>
