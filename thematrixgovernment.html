    <h1>THE MATRIX GOVERNMENT</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Government as a business</p><p>The Matrix Government is a <a href='thematrixholdings.html'>company in The Matrix</a> that, once democratically elected, provides services to citizens for a fixed yearly fee. It maintains libraries, public property, transit, and a welfare program. The company is continuously audited by a transparent publicly verified open-source auditor bot.</p><p>This government encourages monopolies or enpolies (from n poly). Companies are encouraged to capture entire industries by being the best companies in that industry. The people that make the best company reap the greatest rewards, but if a team makes a better (more efficient, leaner) company for an industry, the government encourages replacement of the incumbent company with the new one in the market enpoly. This ensures the best company rules the market, and the criteria for best is determined by people and algorithms. One of the biggest problems of monopolies is stagnancy; monopolies become stagnant due to their massive sizes. They fail to innovate and reap highest rewards due to market dominance. The Matrix Government regulates this through an annual company review that tests incumbents and competitors on a scale to determine which company should dominate a particular industry or market. This maintains a free market in an enpoly system. Since The Matrix Government is incentivized for the good of its electorate, it acts as a trusted control layer over corporations to maintain a free market not corrupted by lobbying. The Matrix Government profits from certain businesses and funds loss leaders like free healthcare, education, housing for all, national parks, and libraries. These services build trust in The Matrix Government.</p><p>This system of governance will stand up for elections in many states and countries. A very simple effect of The Matrix Government being democratically elected in multiple countries is that government websites in different countries will be streamlined. The same architecture for a ministry of health website will exist in different countries. This will streamline the healthcare experience for people who switch countries. You can expect the same standard of healthcare in every state or country where The Matrix Government is elected. This concept is extended to government services, international visas, company registration etc.</p><p>Taxes will be a fee, not percentage. This applies to individuals and companies, though they will pay different taxes.</p><p>The Matrix Government wishes to usher in a new era of democracy where companies are elected to provide governmental services. The Matrix Government does not wish to be the only company standing up for elections. We want to compete with other companies in elections. The idea is that governments have become so complex that companies can represent them better than people. Even though The Matrix Government will be a monopoly once elected, it is only because there can only be one goverment for a citizen. This monopoly will be subject to the same scrutiny as other companies in enpolies; the market in this case is governance. Other companies with better models are encouraged to stand up for elections against The Matrix Government.</p><p>In this sense, the government is a company. A money-making machine that makes itself more efficient over time through scientific discoveries. Efficiency gains translate to greater profits that are spent for the good of its citizens (or lower prices for goods).</p>
