Soak the Mini in 1 L of DI water for 15 mins.<br>2. Put 50 ul of antibody solution into column, cap the Mini and place in a flotation device for dialysis (500ml buffer solution)<br>3. Use low speed setting on a stir plate so that the flotation device is not submerged; change buffer for 3 times. If dialysis overnight, put in fridge.<br>4.
