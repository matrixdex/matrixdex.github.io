                        <p>β-Gal Staining of Xenopus Embryos</p><p>Procedure</p><p>1. Fix embryos for 30 minutes to1 hour (no more!) in MEMFA (while nutating).<br>2. Rinse 2 times with PBS + 2 mM MgCl2.<br>3. Transfer to staining solution (max. volume). <br>4. Transfer to X-gal mix: add 100 λ of the 50 mg/ml stuff (small brown bottle in -20 °C freezer) per 5 ml of embryo sample in staining solution. Use a minimal volume (5 ml is more than enough for 1 scint. vial) – this stuff is expensive. To develop more rapidly and with a deeper purple color, add 5 λ  of NBT (NBT stock as for in situs:  75 mg/ml in 70% dimethyl formamide / 30% water) to 10 ml of final developing mix. <br>5. Incubate at 37 °C in the dark (wrapped in tin foil) until desirable stain develops (a few hours to 24 hours). <br>6. Rinse in PBS, and twice in Methanol. Samples can be stored here. <br>7. Clear in Benzyl Benzoate : Benzyl Alcohol (2:1) if desired. BB:BA is very toxic; it is not water mixable (clean glass with ethanol) and melts plastic, so use it in glass only. It will also leech the stain out of embryos (which become brittle) in a while. You should photograph your samples in a watch-glass.
